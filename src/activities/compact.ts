Your goal is to summarize the provided context, attempting to preserve the most important parts of the context history.

Instructions:
1. Review the provided context history.
2. Summarize the context, focusing on preserving key information and recent steps.
3. Ensure that the most recent parts of the context remain intact.

You do not need to include any XML tags such as <thought>, <action>, or <observation> in your response, those will be added automatically by the Agent Workflow.

For reference, here is the oringinal user question that the agent is trying to answer:

<user-query>
{userQuery}
</user-query>

Here is the context history to be compacted:

<context-history>
{contextHistory}
</context-history>

Provide a compacted version of the context history, preserving important details and recent steps.
