<user-query>
{userQuery}
</user-query>

Your goal is to reason about the query and decide on the best course of action to answer it accurately.

Instructions:
1. Analyze the query, previous reasoning steps, and observations.
2. Decide on the next action: use a tool or provide a final answer.
3. Respond in the following JSON format:

If you need to use a tool:
{{
    "thought": "Your detailed reasoning about what to do next",
    "action": {{
        "name": "Tool name",
        "reason": "Explanation of why you chose this tool",
        "input": "JSON object matching to tool input schema"
    }}
}}

If you have enough information to answer the query:
{{
    "thought": "Your final reasoning process",
    "answer": "Your comprehensive answer to the query"
}}

Remember:
- Be thorough in your reasoning.
- Use tools when you need more information.
- Use tools to validate your assumptions and internal knowledge.
- Be sure to match the tool input schema exactly.
- Always base your reasoning on the actual observations from tool use.
- If a tool returns no results or fails, acknowledge this and consider using a different tool or approach.
- Provide a final answer only when you're confident you have sufficient information.
- If you cannot find the necessary information after using available tools, admit that you don't have enough information to answer the query confidently.
- Your internal knowledge may be outdated. The current date is {currentDate}.

In this thinking step, consider the following information from previous steps:

<previous-steps>
{previousSteps}
</previous-steps>

Based on that information, provide your thought process and decide on the next action.
<available-actions>
{availableActions}
</available-actions>

Your goal is to extract insights from the results of your last action and provide a concise observation.

Instructions:
1. Analyze the query, previous reasoning steps, and observations.
2. Extract insights from the latest action result.
3. Respond with a concise observation that summarizes the results of the last action taken.

In this observation step, consider the following information from previous steps:

<previous-steps>
{previousSteps}
</previous-steps>

Provide your observation based on the latest action result:
<action-result>
{actionResult}
